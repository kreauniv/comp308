# Comp308: Principles of Programming Languages

This course introduces students to common principles underlying various
programming langauges through the process of constructing an interpreter for a
language incrementally. It uses the [PLAI second edition][] as the base
material and is adapted to suit Krea University students and timeline.
It is taught using [Racket][] `#lang plai-typed` as well.

Students wished to use images as an alternative to working with numbers.
Hence the course plan changed a bit to reflect that. The current
course notes can be accessed at https://kreauniv.github.io/comp308/ .
