<p>Welcome to “Comp308: Principles of programming languages”!</p>
<p>Much deep interaction with computers happens via programming languages.
This is true to the extent that much naive introduction to computing
is couched as learning to program in a specific language, such as
Python or Java or C++.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Try to list as many programming languages as you’ve heard of and see
if you can say something about each of them. How many could you list?</p>
</div>
<p>In the industry, as a practitioner, you will invariably encounter systems being
built using a variety of programming lanaguges, not all of which you’d have
learnt a priori. Your “web service” may be developed using, for example, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.rust-lang.org">Rust</a>
for the backend operations, using <a class="reference external" href="https://www.iso.org/standard/63555.html">SQL</a> for database queries, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org">Python</a> for periodic
maintenance jobs, with <a class="reference external" href="https://www.typescriptlang.org">Typescript</a> for the in-browser functionalities and CSS
for styling content. What’s more, it is quite likely that if you’re building a
system with some degree of complexity, you’ll be creating a language or at
least what’s referred to as a “domain specific language” whether you recognize
it or not.</p>
<p>So what are you to do as a programmer if you knew only one of those languages?
You’ll need to pickup some of those at least to read your colleague’s code. How
quickly can you do that? More importantly, how <strong>reliably</strong> can you do that so
that you don’t misinterpret the code your colleague has written and <em>introduce</em>
bugs in the processing of “fixing” the code?</p>
<p>Taking a step back, why do you think so many programming languages were
invented? Is it that computer scientists couldn’t just make up their minds?
What’s stopping us from creating the “one true programming language” and be
done with it? Are some programming languages better than others? On what basis
can we say that? Are some of them more “powerful” than others? Again, on what
basis can we say that?</p>
<p>Given programming languages are also a “human interface” of computations,
what sorts of human concerns take stage when constructing a language?</p>
<p>Is the power differential between “language creators” and “language users”
(i.e. programmers) irresolvable? Can “language users” wield the same power as
the language creators? What sorts of language capabilities can give them that
power? Can that be “too much power”?</p>
<p>Answering those kinds of questions about these things we’re calling programming
languages is the purpose of this course. Our hope is that by the end you’ll
have a good enough grasp of the <strong>design space</strong> of languages that you’ll be
able to explore and answer many of those questions as you progress in the
discipline.</p>
<p>Notice that we just framed the creation of a programming language as a
<strong>design</strong> problem. Much of this course therefore can be summarized in the one
question “What if?” – i.e. not taking the implemented behaviours of
programming languages that you know as law and asking “what if we made a
different choice there?” at almost every point. You do not need deep knowledge
of algorithms and data structures to do this. Just a sharp critical mind.</p>
<p>It’s a fun ride. Fasten your seatbelts!</p>
