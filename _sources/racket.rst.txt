Racket
======

We'll be using the Racket_ programming language as the base language to work
through this course. Racket_ is a dialect of Scheme_ (by which we usually refer
to the standard "R5RS_" or more recently "R6RS_"). Racket_ offers facilities 
based on which other languages can be defined and used, using the a declaration
such as ``#lang racket`` at the top of your source code files.

.. index::
   single: #lang plai-typed

For our purpose, we'll be using the "PLAI typed" language which is declared
using ``#lang plai-typed``.

Installation yada yada 
----------------------

You're in your 3rd year of the CS stream. So some expectations will be placed
on you.

1. **On you:** You have the Racket_ link given to you. So you're expected to
   figure out how to install the Racket environment on your computer, run the
   DrRacket program, read documentation and figure out the basics of opening a
   file, putting some code in it, running it, interacting with your defined
   functions etc. all on your own. You can draw on your peers, of course.

2. **On us:** We will introduce you to the language itself, which is rather new
   to you. So you don't have to teach yourself the language ... which would
   make this course rather pointless. You're only expected to figure out the
   mechanics of the software on your own.

3. **On you:** Use each other for "tech support". Some of you may figure out
   the mechanics quicker than others. Those who are having trouble should seek
   the help of those who've succeeded. Use the course discussion group to
   resolve your issues among yourselves.

4. **On us:** If you're having difficulties understanding certain concepts or
   why some particular program doesn't behave as expected, reach out to us. Of
   course, you're welcome to reach out to your peers too, but we'll help you
   figure that out.

5. **On you:** You're expected to be reasonably comfortable with the idea of a
   "shell" a.k.a. "command line" a.k.a. "REPL", where you enter commands
   and results get printed out. We will not demand expert level knowledge
   of shells/REPLs and only basic familiarity is needed for the course.

While we'll spend a couple of lectures with the basics of Racket and the
``plai-typed`` language, the pace of the course will be tight and you could
find yourself struggling to keep up if you do not work on the assignments to
learn and improve your understanding.

A note on **collaboration**. You're welcome to collaborate on problems with
your classmates initially. As we go along, we urge you to work more and more on
your own. Collaboration can help improve your understanding but should
**never** result in copied code. Understand through discussion, but work
through the code and problem solutions yourselves. Course notes posted in
tandem with the class sessions should help you along too. For obvious reasons,
collaboration will not be permitted during quizzes.

Why Racket?
-----------

Racket and Scheme are both dialects in the "LiSP" family of languages. If
you're not aware already, "LiSP" stands for "LiSt Processor" -- a name given
due to its extensive usage of the "list" data structure to represent both code
and data. There is close relationship between the "abstract syntax tree" of the
language and its textual form which is a flattened representation of the tree
called an "s-expression" (for "symbolic expression"). This simplicity pays off
a lot when we're interpreting our own language as well as when we're working
with lambda expressions.

The Racket environment is very student friendly, if not the most student
friendly programming environment you'll find. It also has a long history of CS
pedagogical work behind it. So we expect you'll have a pleasant experience
working with it.

Working with a LiSP language can elicit many reactions ranging from "why so
many parentheses, damn it!" on one end all the way to "how are people
tolerating other languages!" at the other end. It has been described, for
example, as "not a language, but a building material", and as "a programmable
programming language". Hopefully, you'll see its value for the purpose of
this course and how you can take these learnings forward no matter what
languages you work in.
